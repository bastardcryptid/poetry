			<br>***
			<br>I plead for entry at her lips,
			<br>Starving for her like a dying one
			<br>for another breath. She only weeps
			<br>at my gloomy song, a caravan
			<br>of my thoughts falling into silence
			<br>as our tongues intertwine 
			<br>with our souls. No finesse,
			<br>just two beings holding on to signs 
			<br>of life in each other. Drowning 
			<br>in her sweetest noises, I reach 
			<br>down to her lips. She’s vowing
			<br>that this moment is eternity. Peach 
			<br>lipstick stains my teeth as we 
			<br>drink each other in. She tastes 
			<br>of chemical fruits, green tea
			<br>and slightly of the constricting lace 
			<br>of others’ expectations. Love
			<br>is too grandeur a thing. She sighs 
			<br>when she lets go of her suave
			<br>and artificial posture. Lies 
			<br>are not to be shared this very night. 
			<br>
			<br>I gently run my finger through 
			her<br> atlas fullness. Her light 
			<br>feathery touches die off too soon
			<br>as she closes her eyes. Her melody
			<br>fills the room and completes me.
			<br>
			<br>I whisper to her, “Carpe diem,”
			<br>and kiss the silk of her skin
			<br>everywhere I can reach. My tongue
			<br>is salty and a touch sour.
			<br>But to me it never feels wrong, 
			<br>she gets sweeter by the hour
			<br>(and more loved by the second).
			<br>
			<br>I sip her nectar and relish
			<br>in her ecstasy. She reckons
			<br><i>I love her pleasure,</i> to embellish, 
			<br><i>more than mine.</i> There is truth 
			<br>to her words. Directions
			<br>start  to mix. I try to sooth 
			<br>her mind with kisses of intention. 
			<br>
			<br>She fills my world with her own
			<br>smell and song, enchanting
			<br>and delicate. The hardest stone
			<br>resonates with desire. Inviting,
			<br>her love captivates me, grasps
			<br>in its hold. I am willing. 
			<br>Honey-thick seizures stop. I cast 
			<br>a glimpse at her bitten lip. Reeling
			<br>in my drunkenness on her I kiss it better.
			<br>
			<br>From believing and her, I have chosen the latter.
			<br>***
			<br>If I believed there was a deity, I would have said that kissing her was heaven and should I be sent to hell for loving her, I would have repeated every moment with her twice.

			…her lovely brown skin and eyes to match, they held me captive in a sweet surrender. i was to follow every word she spoke; and every glance and every movement rendered me more and more in love. and hypnotized by beauty that i saw in her dear smile, i never was again to leave her side, and that was how i liked it. dark as night, the jumper that she helped me take off her was the same tone as my black silk sheets; her hair darker black, as the stream i wanted to card my fingers through. she pulled me into an embrace, leaving kisses wherever she could reach. i wished her to be happy, there she was, she whispered promises that she was happy now; i smiled at that little treat and then went down. and that’s how it repeats each time she wants my touch…

			<h3>Lovely silk and lingering feelings</h3>
			It's the caramel you have yearned 
			<br>for for three years now. You still
			<br>cannot believe you have earned
			<br>or, rather, been granted the thrill
			<br>and the right to taste it. Your bright 
			<br>eyes scream of inexperience, darling
			<br>You tilt your head, lick a stripe
			<br>over wettening heated sugar, starving,
			<br>watching the dance of the adored. 
			<br>You want to do what is good, but you
			<br>don't know the difference between the core 
			<br>and the details. I'll tell you the truth;
			<br>listen, girl, no one knows the border 
			<br>between good and bad either. 
			<br>Do it in strict and yet gentle order. 
			<br>Just say you will love her,
			<br>feel it completely in your very soul
			<br>and kiss the sweetest spot 
			<br>with the very tip of your finger. 
			<br>Don't start treating her like a role 
			<br>in a play, that is the worst of the lot
			<br>and it never works, only lingers.
			<br>Catch her song with your lips, 
			<br>listen to it intently and well;
			<br>one time it will save you from hell,
			<br>other times your soliloquy will be sips
			<br>of the coffee you will make
			<br>tomorrow morning.
			<br>You can see the icing coming off the cake
			<br>and you see an ocean, not a warning.
			<br>You are still young, love, please ignore 
			<br>all the signs on the beach, on shore
			<br>and drown in the sea of delight. 
			<br>Dip your little finger and revel
			<br>At the sweet noises and sweeter yet sight.
			<br>You are not seduced by a devil,
			<br>dear, it is love given by wisdom. 
			<br>Athena grants you with right to love,
			<br>Aphrodite - with love as her kingdom. 
			<br>Let your fingers and tongue play like doves
			<br>and drink her in, her essence in ecstasy
			<br>and give it back as you would a kiss. 
			<br>
			<br>For now is not the time of fantasies 
			<br>as long as you're both in bliss.

		<div class="poem" id="shimmering">
			Once, shimmering with pleasure of existence,
			<br>I poured myself a lovely glass of wine.
			<br>The weather, as it goes, was abysmal,
			<br>The worst, of course, was only yet to come. 
			<br>And as I drank the small degree of fire,
			<br>One ninth of rain and two fifths of love,
			<br>The world did all but shiver with desire,
			<br>Anticipation of and pleasure dire
			<br>That lends itself to innocently starved.
			<br>
			<br>And as I closed my eyes, she leaned in closer,
			<br>I opened them - she nearly ran away.
			<br>I smiled at her and let the sweet composer 
			<br>think through her song and how she wanted play. 
			<br>The hand... it held a glass and not a quill,
			<br>And heart just fluttered in its little cage.
			<br>I wanted not forget the loving skill, 
			<br>But rather let my wine breathe air and age
			<br>a while, and find delight in waiting,
			<br>in lust and sweet desire growing strong, 
			<br>before its peak is followed by a sating
			<br>view of my darling’s luscious skin of satin 
			<br>across my red silk sheets forever more.
			<br>
			<br>I sipped my love, not touching saccharine 
			<br>fruits from a golden vase upon the table.
			<br>Oh, let the passion simmer, sparkling wine
			<br>and summer are erasing all the labels.
			<br>And my mistake – why, grave mistake! that I
			<br>would have repeated each and every time
			<br>I found myself out of hellish cry – 
			<br>my dying wish: I looked into her eyes.
			<br>
			<br>That look of lust - and then her honeyed lips
			<br>were warm and plush against the poet’s song.
			<br>Her sky-grey eyes one second held a mist,
			<br>a moment later all the mist was gone. 
			<br>The passion that remained was as soft
			<br>and delicate as kindest bush of roses,
			<br>yet such was flame in kisses so oft 
			<br>that even writ in words it juxtaposes. 
			<br>And tenderer than velvet was her skin
			<br>that lovelier than wine felt on my tongue.
			<br>Oh, all the ways that I loved her... unseen,
			<br>unheard, undone, for me she was the world.
			<br>
			<br>I wrote the sweet adoring on her breast, 
			<br>She sang the most beautiful of songs, 
			<br>Melodious as I moved to the rest... 
			<br>A year and a day that night was long. 
			<br>
			<br>And as she lay on me, undone and spent, 
			<br>My ear caressing with her breathing sweet 
			<br>I felt my heart about to relent. 
			<br>I followed it to darkness and, content, 
			<br>I turned the street so you and I could meet.

			and the inside of your thighs felt like home 
			<br>I had never known. I break the dome 
			<br>by leaving a sadistic line of liquid 
			<br>that has you trembling. Sequence 
			<br>of our movements is the golden
			<br>ratio of life. We're intertwined. Folding
			<br>onto me, you let out a series of sighs, 
			<br>dotted with one, one, two, three and five, 
			<br>leading us both to eternity. We'll be
			<br>
			<br>forever young, my love, in this moment 
			<br>of ecstasy. For ever connected in the sonnet
			<br>of light and adoration. 
			<br>If this is sin, I'll be the devil 
			<br>of a fleeting vacation,
			<br>your happiness ephemeral, not mellow;
			<br>it has me shuddering. 
			<br>The difference staggering, 
			<br>your monologue stabs me below 
			<br>my breasts and inside my thighs. 
			<br>I lift my head and whisper, low, 
			<br>endearments that caress your life, 
			<br>your ears and skin. You're good to me,
			<br>my darling. The drag of my sini-

			<br>You talk, I sigh and reach down, to an unsung
			<br>pleasure of existence. You plead;

			Touch me while your heady smell fills

			<br>lying on you, sunshine

			<br>
			<br>Touch me and keep down the sighs

			<br>stealing your mom’s cigarette,

			<br>The river of my tongue passes through
			<br>between your breasts and over sunlit

			<br>You whisper, beg for more, and I admire

			<br>that’s already melted around the edges
			<br>of an imperfect sphere.
			<br>
			<br>I learn your hidden desires

			<br>and kissing your less-than-pristine neck
			<br>and listening to you.
			<br>As you can’t hold it in
			<br>and whisper through your moans
			<br>what you want,
			<br>where and how;
			<br>I learn, and note,
			<br>and remember.
			<br>
			<br>I learn your softer side 
			<br>as I wake up in one bed with you 
			<br>and watch your eyes open,
			<br>slowly,
			<br>tenderly. 
			<br>You smile at me and 
			<br>mess my hair up,
			<br>as you leave the smallest kiss
			<br>on my cheek,
			<br>not a care in the world
			<br>except for morning breath.
			<br>
			<br>I learn your darker side

			<br>all claws and teeth
			<br>and words that burn. 
			<br>I never want to fight with you,
			<br>but I know
			<br>what I should do
			<br>when you let the shadow out.
			<br>
			<br>I learn new languages  
			<br>as I lick unknown letters
			<br>into your skin.
			<br>
			<br>I learn about new lands, 
			<br>as I map you out
			<br>with my hands and my lips;
			<br>as I explore the expanse of your skin,
			<br>I know I’ve found 
			<br>uncharted territory.
			<br>
			<br>I learn your beauty 
			<br>from watching you from across 
			<br>a hallway,
			<br>your shining smile, 
			<br>the fake one, 
			<br>that still captures my heart.
			<br>You never liked them at all,
			<br>but you laugh in a sweet way,
			<br>and oh how my heart aches
			<br>to hear the real one.
			<br>
			<br>I learn to worship 
			<br>by worshipping you,
			<br>on my knees,
			<br>above you,
			<br>in front of you,
			<br>behind you, 
			<br>between your legs,
			<br>on top of you, 
			<br>pinning you to the wall,
			<br>or holding you to the glass on the thirtieth floor;
			<br>while religion comes in all sorts of ways and forms,
			<br>mine is learning you
			<br>from all perspectives.
			<br>
			<br>I learn about the collision of two subjects 
			<br>while rolling around with you,
			<br>deciding who’s the loving one tonight.
			<br>
			<br>I learn about the sweetness of your kiss

			<br>the world is seen much clearer
			<br>and everything is much more real.
			<br>
			<br>The fog of continuity and overthinking
			<br>is left to those who would deny us
			<br>the most profound of experiences.

			<br>One day our paint will crack,

			<h3>White</h3>
			It was the colour of your skin,
			<br>trembling at my touch,
			<br>that mesmerised me. 
			<br>
			<br>Hands shaking, I pulled you in
			<br>to my bedroom, much
			<br>of which was only lies. Three
			<br>
			<br>o’clock was time for only us:
			<br>the school was done
			<br>and parents were
			<br>
			<br>working the hardest to surpass
			<br>what we under the sun
			<br>call simple blur
			<br>
			<br>in limits of their knowledge. 
			<br>We fell to the floor, 
			<br>laughing towards the ceiling,
			<br>
			<br>which before college
			<br>and what life had in store
			<br>seemed to be stealing
			<br>
			<br>the brightness of the light,
			<br>blinding us into bliss.
			<br>
			<br>My lips were paper-white
			<br>until I stole an even whiter kiss.

			<h3>Rosy</h3>
			A rose is not a rose but for its name,
			<br>Without the name a rose is soft to touch,
			<br>Eager to please one with a gentle smell
			<br>And easy on the eye. A rose as such
			<br>Does not exist outside of one’s perception,
			<br>A human construct ready to be laid
			<br>On any of additional conceptions
			<br>That outside of mind will quickly fade. 
			<br>
			<br>That’s why I never call my youthful lover
			<br>A rose, a waning symbol of desire; 
			<br>But rather she’s my darling, my debut.
			<br>She takes my hand and makes me go higher
			<br>Than any of my dreams could ever do.
			<br>She’s rosy, parting gentle silky gates
			<br>Of lips that here I kiss with all my passion,
			<br>Although it’s all done in the best of tastes.
			<br>
			<br>And if this love by time can be surpassed,
			<br>My lover is the first but not the last.

			<h4>I dream of you</h4>
			in your narrow bed, your hand between your thighs.
			<br>Looking up at me so innocently.
			<br>You tremble as you sigh, almost contentedly 
			<br>as your hand draws circles on your breasts. 
			<br>
			<br>Your finger reaches its place.
			<br>You shiver and arch your back
			<br>And let me watch.
			<br>
			<br>You let my gaze wash over you as I sit back
			<br>and listen to your pleasure.
			<br>
			<br>You hear, “Good, my girl.
			<br>A little more,” and whimper.
			<br>
			<br>So delicious, so eager for me,
			<br>yearning to give me everything. 
			<br>
			<br>You whisper, “Please.” 
			<br>
			<br>I lick at your lips and the entrance 
			<br>to your ecstasy. 
			<br>
			<br>You shake and let out a soft moan.
			<br>And with that you are undone.

			<h4>I think of you</h4>
			scrambling into the kitchen where I’m making pancakes,
			<br>wearing nothing but my flannel.
			<br>You let out a yawn and ask,
			<br>“What’s for breakfast?” 
			<br>
			<br>I want to say, “Making pancakes.”
			<br>I want to say, “What would you like?”
			<br>I want to say, “Whatever you want.”
			<br>
			<br>Instead, I grin, “You.”
			<br>
			<br>You laugh so sweetly when I swoop you
			<br>onto the edge of the kitchen island. 
			<br>
			<br>I lay you back and pull up your thighs,
			<br>until your shins are laying on my shoulders. 
			<br>
			<br>You’re still smiling
			<br>at the sweep of my tongue.
			<br>“Ah, love you.”
			<br>I hum in response, which makes you
			<br>arch your back. 
			<br>And choke on a moan.
			<br>
			<br>And then I hum the whole symphony for you,
			<br>and you sure like to put on a show,
			<br>but you bury you hands
			<br>deep in my hair,
			<br>just stroking through them. 
			<br>
			<br>Your feet try to bring me closer, 
			<br>but my hands just tickle them
			<br>to hear your intoxicating laugh.
			<br>
			<br>And then my hand joins my tongue
			<br>and you let out soft breaths,
			<br>wordlessly saying you are close.
			<br>
			<br>This time I’ll make it easy,
			<br>it’s not the time to play with you.
			<br>
			<br>You are as endearing as they come 
			<br>and I work my finger
			<br>over that lovely spot
			<br>that makes you see stars 
			<br>and moan, as you do now.
			<br>
			<br>“Love you, too. 
			<br>Good?”
			<br>“I definitely liked that.”

			and holding you up is not too hard.
			<br>You tell me it’s summer,
			<br>you’re not cold against the window.
			<br>
			<br>You have your oversized T-shirt on
			<br>And I am fully dressed for the meeting
			<br>except for the bowtie. 
			<br>
			<br>“Good,” I answer and grin,
			<br>as I hook your leg on my elbow
			<br>and hold you to it. 
			<br>
			<br>You laugh as I draw marks on your precious skin,
			<br>but then the laughter dies as I bite on your pristine neck.
			<br>
			<br>I love to mark you.
			<br>Girl, you love knowing whom you belong to.
			<br>
			<br>I know you will always come running to me.
			<br>
			<br>“Lower, lower,” you gasp out, 
			<br>not wanting your parents to know it
			<br>and yet yearning for everyone to see: 
			<br>you’re mine. 
			<br>
			<br>“Okay, kitten,” I chuckle
			<br>and move lower, biting hard on your collarbone.
			<br>You love the pain and let out a moan,
			<br>absolutely sinful and so lovely.
			<br>
			<br>I let my finger slip
			<br>past the tight little ring 
			<br>and slowly stroke the inside
			<br>to make you pant,
			<br>
			<br>before moving on to the main treat. 
			<br>
			<br>And then I hit it and go over
			<br>in slow, sure circles,
			<br>while the whole city is below us.
			<br>
			<br>The whole world can see me fucking you,
			<br>my girl.
			<br>Can see your pleasure 
			<br>and taste you whines as I do.
			<br>
			<br>While people and cars pass and Wi-Fi is crashing
			<br>in the coffee shop next door.
			<br>
			<br>And I am loving my beautiful darling.
			<br>
			<br>“They can all see you, should they look up.
			<br>But that’s what you want, isn’t it? 
			<br>You want attention.
			<br>For everyone to know you’re mine.
			<br>And mine only. 
			<br>For them to know only I can fuck
			<br>and love
			<br>and kiss you
			<br>and claim your perfectly tidy neck.”
			<br>
			<br>You come with a sob. 
			<br>
			<br>I lick your ecstasy from my fingers,

			<br>
			<br>“Sorry, dearest, I have to get to the meeting.

			wearing nothing but satin panties,

			<br>When I turn I stop and look.

			<br>You have love in your bottomless eyes,

			<br>Your breath hitches when I crook my finger just right.

			<br>You whisper, “More,” and close your eyes.

			<br>“More, please.” Another slap. 
			<br>Your skin aches, and yet
			<br>you have never felt more alive.
			<br>
			<br>You moan when I use my finger again, 
			<br>and never stop. 
			<br>They come one after the other.
			<br>
			<br>Before long, you’re in syrupy seizures,
			<br>and softly moaning my name.

			<br>"I am."

			<br>You let out a sigh of impatience

			<br>
			<br>Lovely black silk 
			<br>is a nice contrast to the skin
			<br>of your face. 
			<br>
			<br>It's a shame I can't see your eyes. 
			<br>
			<br>"Kiss me."

			<br>I yank your head back,

			<br>"Whose are you?"

			<br>
			<br>I mark your clear skin

			<br>
			<br>I bite there and make you gasp.

			<br>With that, I push aside your lace panties

			<br>to find that sweet spot. 
			<br>
			<br>"So wet for me, babydoll. 
			<br>You want it badly. 
			<br>Want me to spank you?"
			<br>"Right after, ugh, you fuck me. Please."

			<br>I circle your joy and settle on a rhythm.

			<h4>I love you</h4>
			I whisper into your ear, 
			<br>“And the inside of your thighs,” a kiss 
			<br>to your earlobe, 
			<br>“felt like home I had never known.”
			<br>
			<br>You love it when I read
			<br>my poetry to you.
			<br>
			<br>You love the words I say to you
			<br>while you reach down between my legs
			<br>and look up for permission. 
			<br>
			<br>I only nod, go ahead. 
			<br>I go on, “Sequence of our movements,”
			<br>only stopping momentarily, 
			<br>to feel your tongue 
			<br>move against me. 
			<br>
			<br>You moan as I pull your hair, 
			<br>while spilling sinful words like wine, 
			<br>you can never get enough, my love. 
			<br>
			<br>“...in this moment of ecstasy,” I sigh,
			<br>and pull you away, to roll us over 
			<br>and pin your wrists to the bed with mine,
			<br>grinning like a cat at the mouse. 
			<br>
			<br>You start off with a tiny moan
			<br>that promises good things.
			<br>
			<br>I never stop reciting, whispering
			<br>right into your ear,
			<br>kissing it with my lips
			<br>and my breath. 
			<br>
			<br>Your breath is shaking
			<br>as your body is. 
			<br>
			<br>You hardly feel it as I reach down 
			<br>and ease you into it,
			<br>finding your pace 
			<br>like a dove finds home. 
			<br>
			<br>I play with you,
			<br>biting your ear and never ever stopping,
			<br>saying all of my adoring love
			<br>that makes you so hot for me.
			<br>
			<br>You can never find yourself after my poems, 
			<br>but I love finding you in them.
			<br>
			<br>“You plead...” and you do, 
			<br>wordless and lost, you plead with your body,
			<br>canting your hips and moaning
			<br>some ethereal praise. 
			<br>
			<br>“I lead 
			<br>myself to home that is inside your hips,”
			<br>you want to come
			<br>and say so in your ragged breaths.
			<br>
			<br>“Not yet,” I whisper to you, letting my finger fly away 
			<br>to your thighs.
			<br>“No, please...”
			<br>“Not yet,” I bite into your earlobe, while
			<br>your heavy breathing slows down
			<br>and you almost sob with pleasure 
			<br>when I return my finger. 
			<br>
			<br>And yet when you come close to home again, 
			<br>I deny you. 
			<br>
			<br>You are obedient, 
			<br>but your breathing is heavy, 
			<br>filled with all the lost opportunities
			<br>for us to be together.
			<br>
			<br>But we’ll make up for it in time.
			<br>
			<br>“Please!”
			<br>
			<br>And I let my finger fall away again,
			<br>this time I know it will be the last.
			<br>
			<br>“Please...”
			<br>
			<br>You’re nearly breathless and I take pity,
			<br>whispering to you as I know turns you on.
			<br>
			<br>“My good girl, so good for me. 
			<br>All mine, all mine for me to taste, to fuck, to love.
			<br>My best, my everything, 
			<br>mine.
			<br>So good for me, babygirl.
			<br>Come for me.”
			<br>
			<br>You come quickly on my fingers, tired, 
			<br>but so satisfied. 
			<br>You’re boneless on the bed
			<br>and I stroke your hair and face
			<br>and tell you you did so well.
